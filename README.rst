aws-controller
=============

This is a project in Java, that allows the user to fetch their current AWS
infrastructure, save to a JSON formatted configuration file and make changes via
the configuration file.

The project has a similar goal to Terraform from HashiCorp
(https://www.terraform.io/) which I would highly recommend if you are looking
for a more stable and feature rich system. This project is more aimed at
lightweight AWS configuration and management.
